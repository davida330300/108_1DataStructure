## Hash Table
---
### SomeInfo
    consist of four files
        1.  HashTableChained.cpp <-- most of the code write over here
        2.  HashTableChained.h <-- helping, and
        3.  Dictionary.h
        4.  Entry.h the parent class of Dictionary.h consist of:
            Entry(K k,V v)
            K& getkey()
            V& getvalue()


### Requirement
    1.  use DList/DListNode from HW3 to implenment chaining
    2.  the entry is a key-value pair, the type of the key is K, the type of the value is V 
        +-------+---------+       +-------+---------+
        | K key | V value | ----> | K key | V value |
        +-------+---------+       +-------+---------+
    we can recognize the entry as an ListNode

    so,
    1.  include "DList/DList.cpp" & "DList/DList.h" i n  
        HashTableChained.h file
    2.
